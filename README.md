Titanic Challenge by Kaggle

Titanic challenge problem (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/) offers an oppurtunity to practice your data mining and machine learning skills at a beginners level but with interesting challenges. The main goal of this challenge is to predict the fate of each passenger given basic information on his/her status.

Here, I am using python (pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn) packages to predict the fate of passengers using Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers. 

The solution strategy is presented in three parts: 

### 1- Part1: [Exploration of training dataset](Part1.ipnb)
### 2- Part2: [Replacing missing values and adding new features](Part2.ipnb)
### 3- Part3: [Model predictions](Part3.ipnb)


### Requirements:
Python packages: 
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- numpy
